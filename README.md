# MKBHD's Panel Gaps

This C++ program downloads images from a specified JSON API using multithreading to improve performance. It leverages the `libcurl` library for HTTP requests and `nlohmann/json` for parsing JSON data. The downloaded images are saved in a local directory, allowing you to easily access and enjoy them.

## About MKBHD's App

MKBHD's App, while designed to provide users with high-quality wallpapers, has faced criticism for its perceived value proposition. Many users feel that the app is a **rip-off**, primarily because:

- **Subscription Model**: The app often requires users to pay a subscription fee for wallpapers that are freely available elsewhere on the internet. This leads to frustration among users who believe they should not have to pay for content that can be found at no cost.

- **Limited Unique Content**: Some users argue that the app does not offer a substantial amount of unique content compared to what is available on public image hosting platforms. Many of the wallpapers are simply repackaged from existing sources.

- **User Experience**: The app's interface and user experience have also been criticized, with some users reporting that navigating through the app can be cumbersome and not intuitive.

Overall, while the app may have some redeeming qualities, many users feel that the costs associated with it do not justify the content provided.
